# SudokuSolver
A brute force Sudoku solver implementation for inf1010 @ University of Oslo

Q. Does it do anything intersting?\n
A. Not really...\n 
there is gui, you load puzzles and then solve them. You do not have to wait for the program to find all possible soutions before you can view them (ie. the solver runs on a separate thread)
